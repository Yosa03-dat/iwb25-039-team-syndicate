Technical Implementation
Why Ballerina?
Ballerina was chosen for this project because of its exceptional capabilities for building API services:
1. Native HTTP Support
// Built-in HTTP client - no external dependencies needed
http:Client dictionaryClient = check new("https://api.dictionaryapi.dev");
2. Automatic JSON Processing
// Seamless JSON to record type conversion
DictionaryResponse[] definitions = check payload.cloneWithType();
3. Built-in CORS Support
@http:ServiceConfig {
    cors: {
        allowOrigins: ["*"],
        allowMethods: ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]
    }
}
4. Strong Type System
public type SimpleDefinitionResponse record {
    string word;
    string pronunciation?;
    string[] meanings;
    string[] synonyms;
    boolean success;
};

Configuration
Environment Variables
export DICTIONARY_API_URL="https://api.dictionaryapi.dev"
export PORT="8080"
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
Custom Configuration
Update Ballerina.toml for custom settings:
[package]
org = "yourorg"
name = "dictionary"
version = "1.0.0"

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
CORS Errors
Problem: Browser blocks requests from file:// URLs Solution: Use HTTP server (python -m http.server 3000)
API Connection Refused
Problem: Ballerina service not running Solution: Ensure bal run is active and showing server startup messages
Word Not Found
Problem: External dictionary API doesn't have the word Solution: Try different spellings or common words
Port Already in Use
Problem: Port 8080 is occupied Solution: Change port in service.bal or kill existing process
Debugging Tips
1.Check API logs in terminal for detailed error messages
2.Use browser DevTools (F12) to inspect network requests
3.Test API endpoints directly in browser before testing frontend
4.Verify internet connection for external API access
